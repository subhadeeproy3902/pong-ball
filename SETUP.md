# Releases, GitHub Actions & Tokens

Everything about how this repo builds, tests, and ships — and which tokens are
involved (and which you can ignore).

---

## 1. The workflow at a glance

One workflow file, [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml), with two jobs:

| Job | Runs when | Does |
|---|---|---|
| **CI** | every push to `main` and every pull request | `go build` · `go vet` · `go test` |
| **GoReleaser** | only on `v*` tags (e.g. `v1.0.1`) | cross-compiles binaries, builds packages + a Docker image, and publishes a GitHub Release |

They are mutually exclusive — the CI job is skipped on tags, the release job is
skipped on branch pushes — so a normal `git push` only ever runs the quick CI
checks, and only a version tag triggers a real release.

```
git push origin main      →  CI job (build/vet/test)        ✅ fast check
git push origin v1.2.3    →  GoReleaser job (full release)   📦 binaries + release
```

---

## 2. Tokens — what you actually need

There are two tokens in play. **You only have to create one of them, and only if
you want Homebrew.**

### `GITHUB_TOKEN` — automatic, nothing to do
GitHub Actions injects a fresh `GITHUB_TOKEN` into every workflow run. The
workflow grants it `contents: write` (to create the Release) and
`packages: write` (to push the Docker image to GitHub Container Registry). This
is why releases work out of the box — **no personal token required.**

> You do **not** need the personal `ghp_…` token you may have created for
> pushing from your laptop. If you ever pasted one somewhere public, revoke it
> at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.

### `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` — optional, only for the Homebrew tap
GoReleaser can auto-update a separate Homebrew tap repo
(`homebrew-pong-ball`) on each release. Pushing to *another* repo needs a
token with permission to do so — the automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN` can't reach
outside this repo. That's what `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` is for.

Right now the formula step is set to `skip_upload: true` in
[.goreleaser.yaml](.goreleaser.yaml), so **releases succeed without it.** To turn
Homebrew on, see §5.

## 3. Cut a release

```bash
git tag v1.0.1          # pick the next version (semver)
git push origin v1.0.1  # this push triggers the GoReleaser job
```

Watch it run:

```bash
gh run watch            # live status of the latest run
gh release view v1.0.1  # the published release once it finishes
```

To undo a bad tag before/after a release:

```bash
git tag -d v1.0.1               # delete locally
git push --delete origin v1.0.1 # delete on GitHub
gh release delete v1.0.1        # delete the release if one was made
```

---

## 4. What a release publishes

Each `v*` tag produces, attached to the GitHub Release:

- **Binaries** for Linux, macOS, and Windows × amd64 + arm64 (no Windows/arm64),
  as `pong-ball_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows).
- **Linux packages** — `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.apk`.
- **`checksums.txt`** — SHA-256 of every artifact.
- **A Docker image** pushed to `ghcr.io/subhadeeproy3902/pong-ball:<tag>` and `:latest`.
- **A Homebrew formula** (built as an artifact; pushed to the tap only once §5 is done).

---

## 5. Install paths, per platform

The README and website now advertise **only the commands that work today** (the
✅ rows below, plus the Homebrew *tap* form). The remaining rows are the
publishing roadmap — the **Status** column says what works *today* vs. what still
needs publishing (see §6–§7 and §8).

| Command | Status today | To make it work |
|---|---|---|
| `go install github.com/subhadeeproy3902/pong-ball@latest` | ✅ works | nothing — module is public |
| `curl -sSL …/install.sh` piped to `sh` | ✅ works | nothing — script pulls latest release |
| download `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.apk` from Releases | ✅ works | nothing — GoReleaser builds them |
| `brew install subhadeeproy3902/pong-ball/pong-ball` (tap) | ✅ works | nothing — tap is live (see §6) |
| `brew install pong-ball` (no tap) | 🔒 gated | homebrew-core needs 30 forks / 30 watchers / 75 stars (see §6) |
| `winget install pong-ball` | ⏳ [PR #390476](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/390476) | awaiting merge into `microsoft/winget-pkgs` |
| `scoop install pong-ball` (after `scoop bucket add`) | ✅ works | project bucket is live in this repo |
| `scoop install pong-ball` (bare, via Extras) | 🔒 gated | Extras requires 100★/50 forks ([PR #18079](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/pull/18079)) |
| `choco install pong-ball` | ✅ published (in moderation) | nothing — v1.0.0 pushed; the `chocolatey` CI job auto-publishes future tags |
| `sudo apt/dnf/zypper/pacman/apk install pong-ball` | ❌ not yet | get into a distro repo or host an APT/RPM repo |
| `pkg install pong-ball` (FreeBSD) | ❌ not yet | submit a FreeBSD port |
| `sudo snap install pong-ball` / `flatpak install pong-ball` | ❌ not yet | publish to Snapcraft / Flathub |
| `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.pong-ball` | ❌ not yet | merge a derivation into nixpkgs |
| `sudo port install pong-ball` (MacPorts) | ❌ not yet | submit a MacPorts Portfile |

The `install.sh` script auto-detects OS + arch and pulls the matching archive
from the latest release. See §8 for what each "not yet" channel involves.

## 6. Homebrew — enabled

The `homebrew-pong-ball` tap and the `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` secret are configured,
and `brews[].skip_upload` is `false`, so each `v*` tag pushes an updated
`Formula/pong-ball.rb` to the tap. Users install with:

```bash
brew install subhadeeproy3902/pong-ball/pong-ball
```

If a release ever fails on the Homebrew step, it means the `HOMEBREW_TOKEN`
secret is missing or its scope can't push to the tap repo — recreate it as a
classic PAT with `repo` scope (or a fine-grained token with Contents:
read/write on `homebrew-pong-ball`).

## 7. Scoop & WinGet (Windows)

Windows users can already use the prebuilt `.zip`, `go install`, or Docker.
GoReleaser also **generates Scoop and WinGet manifests** on every release
(`scoops:` and `winget:` in [.goreleaser.yaml](.goreleaser.yaml)), currently
with `skip_upload: true` so they're build artifacts and never block a release.
To make `scoop install` / `winget install` work:

- **Scoop** — create a public **`scoop-pong-ball`** bucket repo, ensure a
  token can push to it, and set `scoops[].skip_upload: false`. Then:
  `scoop bucket add pong-ball https://github.com/subhadeeproy3902/scoop-pong-ball; scoop install pong-ball`.
- **WinGet** — point `winget[].repository` at your fork of
  `microsoft/winget-pkgs`, set `skip_upload: false`, and GoReleaser opens the
  catalog PR (subject to Microsoft's review).

## 8. Publishing to more package managers

The commands the README/site advertise (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `choco`,
`snap`, `flatpak`, `nix`, `pkg`, `port`, …) only resolve once `pong-ball` is
actually published to each ecosystem. None of these are automatic — each is its
own (often slow, sometimes review-gated) submission. What each one needs:

- **Homebrew core** (`brew install pong-ball`, no tap) — submit to
  `homebrew/homebrew-core`; needs notability (GitHub stars/usage) to be accepted.
  Until then the tap form in §6 is the working install.
- **Chocolatey** (`choco install pong-ball`) — build a `.nupkg` (nuspec +
  install script) and `choco push` to the community gallery; first submission is
  moderated. GoReleaser has a `chocolateys:` block you can enable.
- **Scoop / WinGet** (bare names) — see §7; flip `skip_upload` and provide the
  bucket repo / winget-pkgs fork.
- **Debian/Ubuntu `apt`, Fedora `dnf`, openSUSE `zypper`** — either get accepted
  into the distro's repos (long), or host your own APT/RPM repo and have users
  add it first. The `.deb`/`.rpm` on the Releases page already work via manual
  `dpkg -i` / `rpm -i`.
- **Arch `pacman`** — for `pacman -S` it must be in the official repos; the
  realistic path is a published **AUR** package (`yay -S pong-ball`).
- **Alpine `apk`** — submit an `APKBUILD` to aports. The `.apk` artifact already
  installs with `apk add --allow-untrusted`.
- **FreeBSD `pkg`** — submit a port to the FreeBSD ports tree.
- **Snap** — package with snapcraft and publish to the Snap Store. (The old
  `snapcrafts:` block was removed; re-add it with a snapcraft build step.)
- **Flatpak** — write a Flatpak manifest and submit to Flathub.
- **Nix / nixpkgs** — write a `buildGoModule` derivation and open a PR to
  `nixos/nixpkgs`; `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.pong-ball` works only after it merges.
- **MacPorts** — submit a Portfile to the macports-ports tree.

Until a channel is live, point users at the ✅ rows in §5 (Go, install script,
prebuilt packages, Homebrew tap, Scoop/WinGet manifests).

## 9. Test the release pipeline locally (no tag, no publish)

```bash
go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/v2@latest
goreleaser check                              # validate the config
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean --skip=publish,docker
# → artifacts appear in ./dist without touching GitHub
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| CI fails on `go test` | run `go test ./...` locally; the physics suite must pass |
| Release fails on Docker push | ensure the repo has Actions → Packages write permission (it's set in the workflow) |
| Release fails on Homebrew | you set `skip_upload: false` without a valid `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` + tap repo — see §6 |
| Release fails on snap | snap packaging was removed; re-add `snapcrafts:` only with a snapcraft install step |
| Game renders odd glyphs | use a UTF-8, 256-color terminal (Windows Terminal, not legacy cmd.exe) |
